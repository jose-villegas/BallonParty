# UIRays
An example of a simple UI rays shader made in Amplify shader editor - https://youtu.be/cjBMEgS-lsk

We're making a game called Pico Tanks - Multiplayer Mayhem and we often create fun stuff that we want to share with the community. http://www.pandaarcade.com/picotanks

This project was build using Unity 2019.1.0f2. The shader is created with Amplify Shader Editor (ASE v1.6.6 rev 00) plugin but you don't need it to run the project, edit or use the shader. ASE will make understanding and editing the shader much easier. http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor

What is in the project? A shader that generate customizable rays from a single point based on a low resolution image.

I hope someone appreciates the share :) Have fun!
